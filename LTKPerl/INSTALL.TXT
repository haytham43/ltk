Install the LLRP binary schema
------------------------------

To use LLRP-XML/Perl, checkout the Perl project from llrp-toolkit.

From Linux or Cygwin (under Windows) the following command works:

   cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@llrp-toolkit.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/llrp-toolkit login

[simply hit ENTER when prompted for the password]
 
   cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@llrp-toolkit.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/llrp-toolkit co -P LTK

Copy Definitions/Core/llrp-1x0-def.xml to LTKPerl/RFID/LLRP/llrpdef.xml .

MAKE SURE TO MAKE THE FILENAME MATCH llrpdef.xml EXACTLY.

RFID::LLRP::Schema needs to be able to find the binary schema
somewhere, and RFID/LLRP seemed like the best place.


Install LibXML and CPAN modules on Linux
----------------------------------------

The LLRP-XML/Perl document-oriented API is heavily dependent
upon the Gnome project's LibXML.

For Linux, use your favorite package manager and/or CPAN to
install it and any necessary Perl modules. I will show here
instructions for the Linux variant I use, but you will need
to massage these for the distribution you use (additional
instructions are welcome contributions).

The necessary Perl modules are (and command to install on
Ubuntu Feisty Desktop):
	TimeDate
		sudo apt-get install libtimedate-perl
	Data::HexDump
		cpan -i Data::HexDump
	XML::LibXML
		sudo apt-get install libxml-libxml-perl
	XML::LibXSLT
		sudo apt-get install libxml-libxslt-perl
	Clone
		sudo apt-get install libclone-perl

	(For the examples only)
	Text::Template
		sudo apt-get install libtext-template-perl

After installing all of the necessary modules, cd to the
Perl/examples directory and run

	./inventory_example.pl -n=reader-xx-yy-zz

where 'reader-xx-yy-zz' is replaced with the DNS name or
IP address of your reader

Also available is

	./simple_encode_decode.pl

For Windows, the following worked for me; your mileage may vary.

Windows Install Notes for LLRP-XML/Perl
---------------------------------------

I tried the Windows setup and was able to install LibXML.

I expanded the contents of bin directory from .zip files for
the different LibXML libraries to c:\tools\libxml

these are:

http://www.zlatkovic.com/pub/libxml/iconv-1.9.2.win32.zip
http://www.zlatkovic.com/pub/libxml/zlib-1.2.3.win32.zip
http://www.zlatkovic.com/pub/libxml/libxml2-2.6.27.win32.zip
http://www.zlatkovic.com/pub/libxml/libxslt-1.1.19.win32.zip

I just took the things appearing in \bin of each package and
placed them in c:\tools\libxml:

Directory of c:\tools\libxml
 
05/29/2007  02:17p      <DIR>          .
05/29/2007  02:17p      <DIR>          ..
05/03/2006  09:57p             888,832 iconv.dll
11/07/2006  12:18a             963,584 libxml2.dll
11/07/2006  12:19a              10,240 xmlcatalog.exe
11/07/2006  12:19a              36,352 xmllint.exe
08/06/2005  04:15p              73,728 zlib1.dll

Then I added c:\tools\libxml to my path in the System panel

Rebooted.

Verified that c:\tools\libxml is in the path by opening a
DOS box and echo %PATH%

You should be able to verify XML install at the cmd prompt
by typing xmllint --version<ENTER>

nb: If xmllint doesn't work, you probably didn't download
and unzip all the necessary binaries, or you didn't set
the path in System panel, or you didn't reboot after setting
the path in System panel. Do not proceed with the rest of
the instructions until you can get xmllint to run.

Next, you should make sure you have a recent vintage of
ActiveState Perl. In these tests, I ran 5.8.8 build 820.

Install the Perl LibXML bindings by typing the following
at Windows cmd prompt:

ppm install http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/ppms/XML-LibXML-Common.ppd
ppm install http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/ppms/XML-LibXML.ppd
ppm install http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/ppms/XML-LibXSLT.ppd

Install other necessary packages:

ppm install TimeDate
ppm install Data-HexDump
ppm install Clone
ppm install Text-Template

cd to Perl\examples directory

perl inventory_example.pl -n=reader-xx-yy-zz
perl simple_encode_decode.pl

where reader-xx-yy-zz is the DNS name or IP address of a
reader or reader simulator

NOTE: If you get an error about llrpdef.xml you probably missed the step:

' Copy Definitions/Core/llrp-1x0-def.xml to LTKPerl/RFID/LLRP/llrpdef.xml '

Thanks in advance for letting me know about success or
failures with LLRP-XML/Perl under Windows.
