[Christian Floerkemeier]

* changed log level when optional parameters are not used at binary encoding (was WARN is now INFO)
[Christian Floerkemeier]

* refactored LLRPMessageFactory.java. This class was moved from org.llrp.ltk.generated.messages to org.llrp.ltk.generated.

* LTKJava now throws an InvalidLLRPMessageException when a LTK-XML message which can be validated against LLRP.xsd (due to the xsd:other) but which uses an extension that has not been defined in the corresponding ExtensionDef.xml
[Basil Gasser]

* resolved bug resulting from XML encoding empty u16v fields such as WriteData element
[Basil Gasser]

* resolved bug that caused problems loading the schemas from a jar (introduced by mistake in a recent commit)
[Christian Floerkemeier]

* resolved issue with decoding of LTK-XML extension parameters in LLRP messages
[Christian Floerkemeier]

* resolved issue with decoding of LTK-XML extension messages which was caused by a bug in LLRPMessageFactory and namespace error in all parameter decodeXML methods
[Christian Floerkemeier]

* fixed bug in BytesToEnd_HEX which did not encode xsd:hexBinary correctly
[Christian Floerkemeier]

* Changed LLRPMessage to throw an InvalidLLRPMessageException if the length of the message received is not equal to the length indicated in the message's length field
[Basil Gasser]

* Fixed bug in xsd:dateTime encoding (time zone was not set correctly)
[Christian Floerkemeier]

* Resolved "Version attribute" issue that was raised in Paul Dietrich's email to the mailing list on 06/09/2008. LTKJava wrongly assumed that the Version attribute was required. If version attribute is not set in LTL-XML message, the version is set to "001" by default.
