Changes with LTKJava 0.1.1 Snapshot (latest in version control)

* Fixed bug in xsd:dateTime encoding (time zone was not set correctly)

* Fixed u16v XML encoding bug which caused a XSD validation error for example for "WriteData" element

* Resolved "Version attribute" issue that was raised in Paul Dietrich's email to the mailing list on 06/09/2008. LTKJava wrongly assumed that the Version attribute was required. If version attribute is not set in LTL-XML message, the version is set to "001" by default.   

* Corrected mistake in org.llrp.ltk.util.LLRPConverter.java command line documentation

* Fixed bug 1849514 (Timestamp problem) after inconsistency between llrpdef.xml and LLRP.xsd was resolved (Bug 1974880)

* Resolved LLRPBinaryDecoder issue in the messaging package of LTKJava. See email and patch by Li Cuizhu from 06/05/2008.

* Refactored org.llrp.ltk.util.LLRPConverter.java and org.llrp.ltk.util.Util.java
